//
//  Q Security Architecture — Semantic Application State Read Tests (Phase 2BH).
//  ui.read_application_state resolves a named running application's AX root element via
//  AXUIElementCreateApplication(pid) — the exact same primitive ui.list_windows/
//  ui.list_menu_items already resolve — and reads its authoritative kAXHiddenAttribute/
//  kAXFrontmostAttribute booleans plus (optionally) its kAXMainWindowAttribute/
//  kAXFocusedWindowAttribute window identity. Deliberately reads the NATIVE AX attributes, never
//  NSRunningApplication heuristics, never frontmost-only inference, never timing, never
//  screenshots. Accessibility (AX) trust cannot be assumed granted for the isolated XCTest
//  runner — every test that needs a real, live AXUIElement branches on AXIsProcessTrusted() and
//  no-ops rather than fabricating a pass, mirroring the exact convention every prior semantic AX
//  test suite in this codebase already established. See
//  docs/PHASE_2BH_SEMANTIC_APPLICATION_STATE_READ.md for the full contract.
//
//  Every live AX target lives in the out-of-process PaceAXFixtureHost (Support/PaceAXFixture.swift),
//  never in this XCTest host: same-process AX calls against AppKit's own windows crash on main-queue assertions or deadlock.
